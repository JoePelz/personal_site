    <p>This was my reel from 2011. I had been working at Rainmaker since 2008 and it was my first job in the industry. I started out as a Junior FX Artist, spent some time as a Lead FX Artist, and then Senior FX Artist.  It was a great time working with great people, and I really enjoyed it.</p>
    <p>Through that period I think I worked on seven Barbie movies, two of which ran simultaneously. I've pulled footage from them into a demo reel and present that to you here.</p>

    <p>Since then I have worked on a Escape from Planet Earth, Ratchet and Clank, Open Season: Scared Silly, and a couple more Barbies.  Putting together a demo reel is challenging though, and some of my projects have yet to be released so I won't have an updated reel for a while yet.</p>
