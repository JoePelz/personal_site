    <p>In my Java II course, the major assignment was to create a painting program.  I was excited to have the opportunity to create a drawing program, and was eager to get into the drawing apis of Java.  It was fun to figure out the whole <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/geom/AffineTransform.html">java.awt.geom.AffineTransform</a> thing. Back to the assignment though.</p>
    <p>The assignment required us to implement much of the functionality you’d generally expect from a drawing program: the ability to draw lines, squares, rectangles, and circles.  The ability to change colors, the ability to save and load files.  One thing that confused me for a while though was the picker tool.</p>
    <p>What does a picker tool do? Does it let you select things like the hand tool?  Does it change the current color like an eyedropper tool? Does it do something else?  I misheard some else mention it as being the pickle tool.  I misread it several times as a “pickle tool.” My partner misread it as a pickle tool.  It was settled.  I was making a pickle tool.</p>
    <p>I actually ended up with all three of those: The ability to select and move, the ability to eyedropper the shape and color to draw, as well as the ability to draw a pickle.  I am quite proud of my pickle—it can be drawn at an arbitrary angle and size!</p>

    <p>Final grade was quite good, but no comments on the pickle feature.</p>
